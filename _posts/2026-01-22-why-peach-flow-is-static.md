summary: "YAGNI, sacrificial architecture, and choosing action over overdesign."
---

peach-flow.ch and peach-flow.com exist.

That statement matters more than how it was built.

## YAGNI Is an Execution Strategy

I deliberately chose a simple static HTML site.

Not because it’s elegant.  
Not because it’s scalable.  
But because **nothing more is justified yet**.

YAGNI is often treated like a slogan.  
Here it’s an execution constraint.

No backend.  
No CMS.  
No framework debates.

Anything beyond a static page would have been speculation disguised as architecture.

## Sacrificial by Design

Early architecture should be **sacrificial**.

If this code survives long-term, that’s a failure of imagination.  
It exists to be thrown away.

This is evolutionary architecture in its most honest form:
- optimize for learning, not longevity
- prefer reversibility over correctness
- accept that today’s solution is tomorrow’s liability

## Why AI Generated the Site

I let AI generate the site on purpose.

Not to move faster.  
Not to cut corners.

But to **learn by doing**.

If PEACH-Flow explores motivation, agency, and action, then avoiding AI out of principle would be hypocrisy.

This was an experiment:
- using AI as a collaborator, not a crutch
- observing where it accelerates thinking
- noticing where it creates false confidence

You don’t understand a tool by theorizing about it.  
You understand it by using it under real constraints.

## Action Beats Architectural Comfort

I could have:
- designed a clean system
- argued for future extensibility
- waited until it felt "right"

Instead, I published a site.

The site is not the achievement.  
The decision to stop thinking and start acting is.

This pattern will repeat.

PEACH-Flow will move forward through small, disposable steps.  
Anything else would be self-deception.
