summary: "Questioning whether external accountability helps or harms before clarity exists, and why getting this wrong would undermine PEACH."
---

PEACH now has a name, a frame, and a site.

But it's still running on 100% assumptions.

That is no longer acceptable.

## What I currently believe
I believe accountability can be **internal and external**.

Internal accountability matters when someone already trusts themselves.
External accountability matters when they don't.

This sounds reasonable.
It may also be wrong.

## Where this belief is weak
I don't yet know **when external accountability helps and when it backfires**.

For some people:
- external pressure creates movement

For others:
- it increases avoidance
- it triggers shame
- it reinforces the feeling of being "behind"

The same mechanism may produce opposite outcomes depending on timing and identity state.

Right now, I don't have a model for that.
That's a problem.

## The real risk
If I get this wrong, PEACH becomes _harmful_ instead of _helpful_.

Well-intended scaffolding could:
- accelerate disengagement
- deepen self-distrust
- optimize for compliance instead of agency

That would violate the core premise of PEACH.

## What would disconfirm my assumption
Any of the following would force a rethink:
- people who only move *after* clarity, never before
- people who shut down under accountability, even when it's light
- people for whom external pressure delays action rather than enabling it

I need to find these cases early.

## What I'm doing next
I'm not designing around this yet.
I'm testing it.

That means customer discovery interviews focused on:
- when accountability helped
- when it harmed
- what changed the outcome

Until that's clearer, PEACH stays deliberately incomplete.

Uncertainty isn't a phase.
It's the input.
