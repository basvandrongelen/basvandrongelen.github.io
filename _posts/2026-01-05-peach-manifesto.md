summary: "This is not marketing or storytelling. This is a public decision log."
---

## Purpose

This is not marketing.  
This is not storytelling.  
This is not self-expression.

This is a **decision log**.

I write publicly to:
- force clarity under uncertainty
- surface and kill weak assumptions
- document real trade-offs, not outcomes
- build trust through consistency, not polish

If this ever optimizes for attention, validation, or narrative coherence, it has failed.

## What This Is

- A founder log, written close to the moment decisions are made
- A record of thinking under constraint
- A trail of assumptions being tested, broken, or discarded

## What This Is Not

- Not a highlight reel  
- Not motivational content  
- Not a funnel  
- Not a promise of success  
- Not therapy  

## Operating Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Decisions first**. I write after committing, not while oscillating.
2. **One post equals one broken belief**. If nothing broke, nothing gets published.
3. **Patterns over anecdotes**. Personal detail only when it exposes structure.
4. **Numbers only when they explain causality**. No vanity metrics.
5. **Cadence beats quality**. Rough and shipped beats silent and refined.

## Red Lines

I do not publish:
- internal conflicts with others
- financial fragility
- half-formed strategies
- anything that erodes trust before users exist

Transparency without judgment is recklessness.

## Fixed Format

Every long-form entry follows this structure:
1. What I believed  
2. What reality did  
3. What broke  
4. What I decided  
5. What this changes  

No exceptions.
