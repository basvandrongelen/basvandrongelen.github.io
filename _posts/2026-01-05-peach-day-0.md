## Why I'm Building This in Public

### 1. What I believed

I believed motivation was mainly a discipline problem.

That if people had the right system, the right accountability, or the right push, they would move.

That belief is convenient.  
It externalizes failure and makes solutions look simple.

### 2. What reality did

Reality kept contradicting it.

People don't stall because they lack information or intent.  
They stall because action threatens how they see themselves.

Motivation doesn't decay randomly.  
It collapses when action creates identity friction.

### 3. What broke

That observation broke the initial framing.

If motivation were primarily about discipline, most tools would already work.  
They don't.

Which means the real problem isn't activation.  
It's **identity safety**.

### 4. What I decided

I decided not to build a motivation product.

PEACH starts from a narrower and less marketable premise:  
Helping people take action **without self-betrayal**.

That immediately limits scale.  
It also removes bullshit.

### 5. What this changes

For PEACH:
- customer discovery comes before solution design
- language matters more than features
- progress will look slow and ambiguous

For this public log:
- I will document decisions, not updates
- uncertainty is allowed, chaos is not
- if PEACH fails, this log still stands

This is Day 0.  
No launch. No claims.  
Just a constraint and a direction.
