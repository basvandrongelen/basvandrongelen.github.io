# Building systems, teams, and companies

I design and build systems: technical, organizational, and increasingly, companies.

- Lessons from founding and building startups
- Reflections on scaling systems and teams

Welcome!

Expect practical thinking, candid observations, and lessons _I wish I'd learned sooner._
