Before building anything else, I changed the name.

This wasn't a branding exercise.  
It was a correction.

## The Problem with the Earlier Names

I experimented with:
- peachflow
- getpeach
- get-peach

They were all defensible.  
They were also all slightly wrong.

The issue wasn't availability or aesthetics.  
It was **incongruence**.

Each variant subtly pulled the project in a different direction:
- *getpeach* sounds like acquisition or growth
- *peachflow* collapses meaning and removes tension
- hyphenation choices started to matter more than they should

That's a smell.

When naming decisions start multiplying instead of collapsing, something is off.

## Why Consistency Matters Early

Early-stage projects don't fail because of bad names.  
They fail because of **cognitive friction**.

Every inconsistency costs attention:
- explaining the name
- defending the choice
- compensating in language elsewhere

I don't have attention to spare.

I want one name, one spelling, one mental model.

## Why "peach-flow"

I chose **peach-flow** deliberately.

Not because it's perfect.  
But because it's *precise enough*.

- *PEACH* is the container. The concept space.
- *flow* describes the thing I'm actually interested in: sustained forward motion.
- The hyphen keeps the tension visible instead of smoothing it away.

This is not about fruit.  
It's not about growth hacks.  
It's about movement without force.

The name reflects that.

## Dropping the Alternatives

I intentionally abandoned:
- peachflow (too compressed, too abstract)
- getpeach / get-peach (too transactional)

Killing names early is cheaper than carrying them forward.

Optionality feels good.  
It also hides indecision.

## What This Changes

- One name everywhere
- One domain direction
- One way to talk about the thing I'm building

This reduces noise.  
It increases commitment.

From here on out, it's **peach-flow**.

Not because it's final.  
But because it's aligned enough to move forward.

And movement matters more than naming debates.
