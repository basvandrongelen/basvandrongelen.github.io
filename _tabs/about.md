I design and build systems: technical systems, organizational systems, and increasingly, companies.

My background is in software architecture: leading teams, solving complexity, and creating structures that scale. But architecture isn't just about code. It's about how people collaborate, how decisions flow, and how systems evolve under real-world pressure.

This site is where I write about what I'm learning along that journey: the trade-offs, the thinking patterns, the failures, the strategy, and the craft.

If you're building software, teams, or a company: you'll probably recognize a lot here.

Thanks for reading.
